						Silverpine Clearing Foxglove Trail
					</div>
<a>Silverpine Clearing</a> is a small natural depression located within the <a>Ashenvale Forest Reserve</a> of northern <a>Vermont</a>, <a>United States</a>. It is known for its dense conifer growth, seasonal fog, and unusually quiet soundscape. Though relatively obscure, the site has drawn attention from hikers and amateur naturalists due to its distinctive microclimate and recurring wildlife patterns.<a><sup>[1]</sup></a>

					<h2>Geography and Environment</h2>
					<p>The clearing lies approximately 8.3 kilometers from the nearest forest access road and can only be reached by unmarked trails or logging paths no longer maintained by the <a>U.S. Forest Service</a>.<a><sup>[2]</sup></a> The area is surrounded by <a>eastern hemlock</a>, <a>silver pine</a> (for which the clearing is named), and <a>red spruce</a>. The ground forms a shallow depression with scattered glacial boulders that have been partially embedded in the soil over centuries of freeze-thaw cycles.<a><sup>[3]</sup></a>
During early spring and late autumn, heavy fog tends to linger in the basin for extended periods, sometimes remaining through the afternoon hours. The soil's high moisture retention has been noted to support moss and lichen species typically found at higher elevations.<a><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
					<h3>Wildlife</h3>
					<p>Silverpine Clearing is home to common northeastern fauna, including <a>white-tailed deer</a>, <a>red foxes</a>, and a notable population of <a>northern long-eared bats</a>.<a><sup>[5]</sup></a> Bird surveys have identified frequent nesting of <a>hermit thrushes</a>, whose calls are amplified in the natural bowl of the terrain, producing a reverberant echo that hikers sometimes describe as “choral.”<a><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
					<p>Locals occasionally report a temporary stillness in the area—an absence of wind or birdsong lasting several minutes—but this phenomenon has not been formally documented.<a><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
					<h2>History and Folklore</h2>
					<p>While the clearing has no recorded indigenous or colonial settlements, forestry maps from the early 1900s mark the area as “unfit for cultivation.”<a><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>
					<p>In regional folklore, Silverpine is sometimes referred to as “The Whispering Hollow,” said to be a place where lost travelers hear distant voices calling them home. The earliest mention of this story appears in an unpublished local history manuscript from 1931, though the tale is largely regarded as a product of oral storytelling among early logging communities.<a><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>
