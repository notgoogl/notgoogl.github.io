					</div>
					<p><a>Cragmoor Forest</a> is a remote, densely wooded area located in the northeastern <a>United States</a>, spanning approximately 2,400 acres of largely undeveloped land. The forest is characterized by its heavy canopy of mixed <a>hardwood</a> and <a>conifer</a> species, deep mossy clearings, and unusually symmetrical rock formations found throughout its interior.<a><sup>[1]</sup></a> Due to its isolation and lack of formal trails, Cragmoor remains largely uncharted outside of local forestry surveys.</p>

					<h2>Geography and Ecology</h2>
					<p>Cragmoor lies within a series of shallow <a>glacial valleys</a> and ridges, bordered to the north by steep <a>shale outcroppings</a> and to the south by the remnants of an abandoned logging road.<a><sup>[2]</sup></a> Seasonal creeks feed into low depressions that rarely dry completely, giving much of the terrain a damp, peaty texture year-round. Vegetation includes <a>hemlock</a>, <a>red maple</a>, and <a>witch hazel</a>, with a ground cover dominated by <a>clubmoss</a> and <a>shelf fungus</a>.<a><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
					<p>Wildlife surveys have recorded <a>white-tailed deer</a>, <a>barred owls</a>, and a large population of amphibians. Locals occasionally report observing deep burrows or sinkholes that appear and vanish between seasons, often accompanied by unusual erosion patterns. Some field biologists have attributed this to unstable subsoil composition, though others have noted a lack of typical runoff indicators.<a><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
					<h2>Folklore and Unusual Formations</h2>
					<p>The most distinctive feature of Cragmoor is its series of stone piles and altar-like platforms, often arranged in near-perfect circles or intersecting lines.<a><sup>[5]</sup></a> These formations are believed to predate any known settlements in the region. Amateur researchers have pointed out their striking geometric precision and their tendency to appear near natural clearings or depressions where the ground sinks slightly toward the center.<a><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
					<p>In local folklore, Cragmoor is sometimes referred to as <i>The Hollow Grove</i> or <i>The Vanishing Clearing</i> — a place where travelers claim compasses falter and sound carries unevenly. Stories collected in the early 1900s describe hunters or loggers who stumbled upon “ringed stones” and reported feelings of vertigo or intense silence before leaving the area abruptly.<a><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
					<h2>Trails and Access</h2>
					<p>Because of its remoteness, the forest has only two known access routes: the Blackwater Ascent, a steep, root-covered path following an intermittent creekbed, and the Ecliptic Way, a narrow ridge trail overgrown with underbrush. Both are considered hazardous and are not maintained by any park service. Visitors are strongly discouraged from entering without navigation equipment, as cell service is virtually nonexistent throughout the interior.<a><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>
