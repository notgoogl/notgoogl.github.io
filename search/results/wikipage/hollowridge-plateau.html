					<p><a>Hollowridge Plateau</a> is an elevated landform situated approximately two kilometers northwest of <a>Grayhaven Village</a> in central <a>New Hampshire</a>, <a>United States</a>. The area is known for its panoramic views of the surrounding lowlands and its unusual circular arrangement of stone outcroppings near the plateau's center. Though often overlooked by larger hiking trails, Hollowridge has become a modest point of interest among local historians and landscape surveyors.<a><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

					<h2>Geography and Geology</h2>
					<p>The plateau sits at an elevation of roughly 610 meters above sea level and spans just under 1.3 square kilometers in area. Composed primarily of <a>granite</a> and <a>schist</a>, the surface is relatively flat, marked by intermittent fractures and shallow depressions formed through centuries of erosion.<a><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
					<p>A distinctive circular arrangement of stones, averaging two to three feet in height, occupies the plateau's central field. Geologists have proposed that frost wedging and sediment displacement may have caused the stones to settle in this pattern naturally.<a><sup>[3]</sup></a> However, the nearly perfect geometry of the ring has led to speculation that it may have been deliberately placed by early inhabitants or settlers.<a><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
					<h3>Flora and Fauna</h3>
					<p>Vegetation on Hollowridge Plateau consists mainly of low shrubs, <a>white birch</a>, and scattered stands of <a>red maple</a> along the plateau's edge. Due to thin topsoil and strong prevailing winds, few large trees grow on the upper surface.<a><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
					<p>The surrounding region supports populations of <a>eastern cottontail</a>, <a>rough-legged hawks</a>, and seasonal migrations of <a>monarch butterflies</a>. A small variety of <a>luminescent fungi</a> has been observed near the stone ring during humid summer nights—likely due to decaying organic matter in the shallow soil layer.<a><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>
					<h2>History and Local Traditions</h2>
					<p>Historical records indicate that Hollowridge was used intermittently as a grazing ground during the late 1800s before being abandoned due to drought and soil depletion.<a><sup>[7]</sup></a> In 1924, a local folklorist, <a>Martha Leland</a>, documented several oral accounts from <a>Grayhaven residents</a> describing “lanterns” seen on the plateau during midsummer nights.<a><sup>[8]</sup></a> These lights were said to flicker in a slow, rhythmic pattern resembling a heartbeat. No official investigation was ever recorded.</p>
					<p>In more recent years, Hollowridge has appeared in regional guidebooks for its “quiet atmosphere and sense of isolation.”<a><sup>[9]</sup></a> <a>The New Hampshire Historical Society</a> has listed the site as an “area of geomorphological interest,” though no archaeological study has confirmed the man-made nature of the central formation.<a><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>
